FindBugs is a defect detection tool for Java that uses static analysis to look for more than 200 bug patterns, such as null pointer dereferences, infinite recursive loops, bad uses of the Java libraries and deadlocks. FindBugs can identify hundreds of serious defects in large applications (typically about 1 defect per 1000-2000 lines of non-commenting source statements). The name FindBugs™ and the FindBugs logo are trademarked by The University of Maryland. As of July, 2008, FindBugs has been downloaded more than 700,000 times. FindBugs requires JRE (or JDK) 1.5.0 or later to run. However, it can analyze programs compiled for any version of Java and is used by many major companies and financial institutions. FindBugs-IDEA uses FindBugs™ under the hood. for more information see http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/.\r\n\r\n...\"We use IDEA inspections and FindBugs complementary. FindBugs is running in our continuous integration process and IDEA inspections are used during coding.\" What about using both during coding from within IntelliJ IDEA?\r\n\r\n * for screenshots see http://plugins.intellij.net/plugin?idea&id=3847\r\n * @see article at dzone: http://jetbrains.dzone.com/tips/intellij-idea-finds-bugs\r\n\r\n### Downloads\r\nPlease download the latest version from http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/3847\r\n\r\n### Supporters\r\nYourKit is kindly supporting FindBugs-IDEA open source project with its full-featured Java Profiler.\r\nYourKit, LLC is the creator of innovative and intelligent tools for profiling\r\nJava and .NET applications.
